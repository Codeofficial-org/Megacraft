# Megacraft
Minecraft is a game where everything is made blocks, and the only limit is your imagination -- someone like you may be waiting for us to say "or is it" so yeah. Who in the world think the only limit is your imagination. I mean, there's so many limits I can list right now: 30,000,000 block border; no mods (on bedrock); usually useless updates; no new items; redstone is too basic (sometimes). So, yeah. That's why we made Megacraft - a game that's *actually* infinite. First off, Java can generate passed the long limit, so the world border shouldn't be programmed in. Second up, mods - built in create mod, replaymod, vm computers mod - all that you'll need. Next, *actually* good updates and better redstone - we call it redstone it really isn't, but what it *is* is for you to find out in-game. Also, IM NOT LEAKING THE WHOLE GAME OUT HERE! If you want it get it. I ain't forcing you.
